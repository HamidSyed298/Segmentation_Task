Welcome to my segmentation repository, where I provide code for
segmenting images and videos into different categories.
Our repository focuses on football and person segmentation
using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
This code is easy to use.
My aim is to simplify segmentation tasks, enabling researchers and
developers to focus on their core objectives 
without worrying about the technical details of image
and video segmentation.
